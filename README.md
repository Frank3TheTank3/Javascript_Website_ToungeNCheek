Review Feb 28

I have tackled many challenges since the beginning of this project. This first problem I encountered was the placement of a background video. The second one was the centering of elements. For the latter, I found different options for achieving the desired effect.
There are following CSS attributes than can be used to center:
Justify-Content: center
Align-Items: center
Align-Self center
Align-Font: center
Translate: x-10;
Left: 50%;
